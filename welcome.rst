Welcome
===================
This short guide is for technical writing students and others who have little or no experience writing in a text editor.

Atom is a free, open source text editor developed by GitHub. For Mac users, Atom may be a good alternative to Notepad ++.

Anyone new to reading and writing computer programming source code should use a text editor with beginner-friendly features. The essential features for beginners are syntax highlighting and live preview.

**Syntax Highligting** displays source code in different colors and fonts, so you can read your code and distinguish various elements more easily.

**Live Preview** is a window that appears next to your source code and shows you what your code will look like on a web page. It's "live" preview because the preview window renders your code while you are typing.

In Atom, syntax highlighting and live preview are add-on features for many programming languages. These features are easy to install and use. Atom for the Beginner: Quick Set Up will show you how to install and use these features for HTML, Markdown, and RST.

.. tip::

	The basic skills you learn here can be applied to other programming languages and features in Atom.
