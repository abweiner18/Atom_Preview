How to Install Atom
*********************************************************************

#. Go to `https://atom.io <https://atom.io>`_. There you will see a download button with your specific operating system (OS) and compatible versions listed above it. For example, I'm running MacOS version 10.11.6, so this is what I see when I go to Atom:

2. If the OS/version information is correct for your system, click the **Download** button and follow the installation instructions.

If the OS/version information is not correct or you want to download Atom for a different operating system:

#. Click on the **Other platforms** button at the bottom left of the Atom homepage window. You will be taken to Atom's latest version release page on GitHub.
#. Click on **Assets** to open the list of the current available OS version downloadable files.
#. To download, click on the appropriate file name for your platform.
#. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.
