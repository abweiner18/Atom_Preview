For the Beginner Using Atom: How to Preview HTML, Markdown, and RST
*********************************************************************

This short guide is for technical writing students and others who have little or no experience writing in a text editor.

Why Did I Write this Guide?
-------------------------------
As a technical writing student, my instructor recommended we use Notepad ++ as our text editor. I use a Mac. Unfortunately, Notepad ++ is not compatible with MacOS. Although my Mac laptop has a text editor, I realized its shortcomings after seeing an example of Notepad ++.

So, I looked around for an alternative. Since we use GitHub in class and Atom is a GitHub product, I decided to try it.

My needs for a text editor are very basic. I only need to:

* Practice writing in HTML, Markdown, and RST.
* Be able to preview what I write.

Installing Atom was super easy, but other basic set-up info was not as obvious for a non-developer like me. It took some time to get up and running, so I want to save other beginners time by sharing my learnings here.

I hope this guide gives you the tools to quickly start writing and previewing your work in Atom *(and gives me some practice creating a project in RST/Sphinx/ReadtheDocs)*.

How To...
